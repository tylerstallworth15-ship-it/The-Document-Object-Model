SBA project reflections

This project helped me understand how the DOM works and how JavaScript can make a page interactive. The biggest challenges I ran into were small mistakes like missing brackets and typos, which completely broke my script and made the Add Post button stop working. Debugging those errors taught me to check the console often and read the error messages instead of guessing.
Another issue I had was with the edit feature, especially getting the form to switch between “Add Post” and “Update Post” correctly. I also had trouble with localStorage at first, but once I figured out how to save and load the posts as JSON, it started working smoothly.
Overall, this project showed me how all the pieces HTML, CSS, JavaScript, events, and localStorage fit together, and even though I got stuck a a lot of times, fixing my own mistakes helped me learn the most. -->
